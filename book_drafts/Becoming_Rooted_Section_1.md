**Becoming Rooted: Leadership Begins at the Altar** 

**Section 1: Scripture & Pattern** 

***Part I: Yod – Seed of Becoming*** 

***Theme: Identity and Inner Architecture*** 

***Spiritual Justification: The altar is not an object. It is a geometry of  return. It is the first square in the soil of the soul where divine fire  meets human offering. It is where leadership begins because it is***  

***where self ends.*** 

Visual Cue: \[Imagine a simple square – symbolizing the altar, the Holy of Holies, and the  cube of New Jerusalem\] 

**A Flicker in the Snow** 

He was starving. Somewhere in the frozen barrens of northern Canada, the explorer lay  curled beside the carcass of a sled dog he hadn’t wanted to kill but had. Snow drifted over  his body like a shroud. Days earlier, the last of his food had vanished, swallowed by the  cruel quiet of the white wilderness. His journal, later recovered, told of bitter wind, failed  traps, and finally—desperation. He ate the liver of one of the dogs. Rich in vitamin A, it  promised survival. But it was poison in that dose. He died alone, only miles from rescue. 

The man’s name was Douglas Mawson. A seasoned explorer. A man of maps and muscle. Yet  in the end, what killed him wasn’t cold or isolation. It was disordered consumption. He  devoured what should have been offered. 

Leadership without an altar does the same. It consumes without calibration. It burns out  instead of burning up. It trades offering for ownership—and ends alone in the snow,  clutching vision like frostbitten limbs that can no longer move. 

**Head: The First Pattern Was a Square** 

The altar was always square. 

Not round like the sun, or jagged like mountains—square. Four corners. Fixed sides. A  container of intention. It shows up first in Genesis as a shadow—a place where Cain and  Abel both bring offerings. Abel’s burns with acceptance. Cain’s lies heavy and cold. 

Why?  
Genesis 4 doesn’t say outright, but the pattern speaks. Abel’s life aligned with offering;  Cain’s revolved around outcome. One brought the first of his flock—without knowing the  result. The other brought some of his crops—after seeing how much he had left. 

Abel operated in trust. Cain operated in control. 

This is the first leadership decision every soul must make: Will I lead from offering or from  outcome? 

**Heart: Cain Still Lives in Me** 

We don’t like talking about Cain. But if we’re honest, most of us start there. 

We offer with a chip on our shoulder. We bring something, but hold something back. We  lead while watching the scoreboard. We pray, but check who’s following. We give—but only  what we won’t miss. 

And when the fire doesn’t fall, we sulk. 

Cain’s pain was real. He felt unseen, unchosen, less than. And God didn’t rebuke his ache— He offered a door: "If you do what is right, will you not be accepted?” (Genesis 4:7). 

The altar isn’t about performance. It’s about posture. Alignment. Letting go of needing to be  enough. 

The ache of Cain is the birthplace of false leadership. It’s where we grasp rather than give,  perform rather than pour. But the fire of Abel still calls out. The first martyr. The first leader  whose voice still echoes because it aligned with the pattern. 

**Hands: Build the Pattern, Not the Platform** 

In a world addicted to platforms, sacred leaders return to altars. 

This begins in quiet. Morning. The square of time. Fifteen minutes to place thought, word,  and action before the Lord. To burn entitlement. To name resentment. To realign. 

Try this: 

\- Choose a small physical square: a mat, a notepad, a corner. 

\- Each morning, return to that place. 

\- Speak aloud: “This is my altar. I offer my day.” 

\- Give God the first. Not the leftovers. 

Leadership starts here—not with a platform, but with a place.  
**Habitation: Living Between the Corners** 

The square isn’t just spatial. It’s temporal. The altar sets the geometry of your day: 

\- Morning: Glory (God above me) 

\- Midday: Presence (God with me) 

\- Evening: Voice (God through me) 

\- Night: Rest (God within me) 

Each corner holds a dimension of His reach (Glenn Clark). This rhythm becomes your  habitation. Your home. Your leadership no longer reacts—it radiates. 

When you live by altar rhythm, your soul becomes the offering. Your leadership becomes  the fire. And your life becomes a holy pattern through which others return to their own  sacred square. 

**Pattern Blessing** 

May your altar burn with unhidden offering. 

May the corners of your life be squared in sacred rhythm. 

May the Cain in you surrender to alignment. 

And may fire fall, not on what you control, but on what you entrust. Amein.
