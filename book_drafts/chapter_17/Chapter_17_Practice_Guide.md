# The 7-Day Aligned Decision Audit
## A Practical Guide from Chapter 17: Intelligent Action

**From "Leading with Heart and Soul" Book 4: Becoming Embodied**
**By David Lee**

---

## Overview

This guide walks you through a complete 7-day process for taking any significant decision through the Tetrahedron Framework. It's designed for one decision over seven days.

**Don't rush it.** Major decisions deserve major attention.

**The Four Points of Aligned Decision:**
1. **BODY** (.382) — What does your animal soul want?
2. **SPIRIT** (.618) — What does your divine soul require?
3. **GAP** (.007) — What must you release for alignment?
4. **ACTION** (1.000) — How do you execute from integration?

---

## Before You Begin

**Choose ONE significant decision.** Write it as a clear yes/no question:

> "Should I _______________________________________?"

**Prepare:**
- A journal or notebook dedicated to this process
- A quiet space you can return to daily
- 20-30 minutes each morning
- 10-15 minutes each evening
- Access to Scripture

## Day 1: Decision Identification & Body Scan

### Morning Practice (20 minutes)

**Step 1:** Write your decision clearly at the top of a fresh page.

**Step 2:** Sit quietly. Place your hand on your chest. Feel your heartbeat.

**Step 3:** Ask your body honestly: *"What do you want in this situation?"*

**Step 4:** Journal everything that comes up. Don't edit. Don't spiritualize. If your body wants money, write "money." If it wants to avoid pain, write "avoid pain."

**Identify the level:**
- [ ] Level 1: Survival need (legitimate)
- [ ] Level 2: Comfort desire (neutral)
- [ ] Level 3: Compulsive craving (warning)

**Questions to answer:**
- What physical sensations arise when I think about this decision?
- What does my animal soul crave?
- Which desires are legitimate needs vs. compulsive cravings?
- Where is there tension in my body around this?

### Evening Practice (10 minutes)

**Review the day:**
- When did your body try to rush this decision?
- When did you catch yourself avoiding it?
- Notice patterns: Fear creates avoidance. Craving creates urgency.

**Prayer:**
> "God, I acknowledge my animal soul's desires. They are real. Help me honor without obeying."

## Day 2: Spirit Scan & Word Alignment

### Morning Practice (30 minutes)

**Step 1:** Open Scripture. Choose passages relevant to your decision:

| Decision Domain | Suggested Passages |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Career/Calling | Jeremiah 1:5, Ephesians 2:10, Colossians 3:23-24 |
| Relationship | 1 Corinthians 13, Ephesians 5, Matthew 18:15-17 |
| Money/Resources | Luke 12:13-34, Matthew 6:19-34, 2 Corinthians 9 |
| Risk/Change | Hebrews 11, Joshua 1:9, Isaiah 43:18-19 |
| Conflict | Romans 12:17-21, Matthew 5:23-24, Proverbs 15:1 |

**Step 2:** Read slowly. Then sit in silence for 5-10 minutes.

**Step 3:** Ask the Holy Spirit: *"What do You want me to do?"*

Don't fill the silence. Let it stretch. The Spirit's voice is quiet. Wait for Him.

**Step 4:** Journal what you sense—not what you *want*, what you *sense*.

**Apply the Three Tests:**

| Test | Question | Your Answer |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Love (1 Cor 13) | If I loved perfectly, what would I choose? | |
| Faith (Heb 11) | If I trusted completely, what would I do? | |
| Kingdom (Matt 6:33) | What advances God's priorities? | |

### Evening Practice (10 minutes)

**Review the day:**
- When did God's voice break through?
- What blocks arose when you heard it?

**Prayer:**
> "Spirit, clarify Your will. Remove my false peace and give me true shalom."

---

## Day 3: Gap Identification & .007 Naming

### Morning Practice (20 minutes)

**Step 1:** Draw two columns on a fresh page:

| My .618 Ideal | My .625 Reality |
|---------------|-----------------|
| (What God seems to want) | (What's actually possible) |
| | |
| | |

**Step 2:** Look at the space between them. That's your gap.

**Step 3:** Name what you're clinging to in that gap. Circle all that apply:

- [ ] Comfort (wanting the easy path)
- [ ] Control (needing guaranteed outcome)
- [ ] Timeline (demanding it happen now)
- [ ] Recognition (needing to be seen/credited)
- [ ] Safety (protecting status quo)
- [ ] Rightness (needing to win/be right)

**Step 4:** Write the specific thing:

> "I am clinging to: _______________________________________"

**That's your .007.** That's what must be released for alignment.

### Evening Practice (15 minutes)

**Wick Meditation:**

Close your eyes. Visualize yourself as a wick. The fire (.618) wants to appear through you. But the wick must be consumed. The .007 burns.

See the flame appearing as you release your grip.

**Prayer:**
> "I release my grip on _______. Let Your will be done."

*If you can't say it honestly, you've found what's blocking you.*

## Day 4: Tetrahedron Integration

### Morning Practice (30 minutes)

Run your decision through all four points:

**POINT 1 — BODY (.382)**

What my animal soul wants:
> _______________________________________________

Legitimate needs identified:
> _______________________________________________

Compulsive cravings identified:
> _______________________________________________

---

**POINT 2 — SPIRIT (.618)**

What my divine soul requires:
> _______________________________________________

Love Test result:
> _______________________________________________

Faith Test result:
> _______________________________________________

Kingdom Test result:
> _______________________________________________

---

**POINT 3 — GAP (.007)**

The .007 I must release:
> _______________________________________________

What dies if I obey:
> _______________________________________________

---

**POINT 4 — ACTION (1.000)**

Aligned decision from integration:
> _______________________________________________

Practical first step:
> _______________________________________________

### Evening Practice (10 minutes)

**Review:**
- Did new clarity emerge today?
- Is resistance increasing? (That's often a sign you're close to truth)
- Are all four points genuinely engaged?

**Prayer:**
> "Make my decision solid as a tetrahedron. Let all four points hold."

---

## Day 5: Sardonyx Orientation Check

### Morning Practice (25 minutes)

**Visualize the sardonyx stone:**
- Onyx layer (dark) = Divine soul (.618)
- Sard layer (red) = Animal soul (.382)
- Properly oriented: Onyx up, sard down

**Ask:** Which layer is facing up in this decision?

**If .618 is leading (properly oriented):**
- How can I consecrate the energy of my .382 to serve this?
- What would it look like to honor my body while letting spirit lead?

**If .382 is dominating (inverted):**
- Where did the hijack happen?
- What spiritual language am I using to justify animal wants?
- What needs to be confronted?

**Write your orientation assessment:**
> _______________________________________________

### Green Heart Practice (5-10 minutes)

1. Place both hands on your chest
2. Close your eyes
3. Breathe slowly for five minutes—don't think, just breathe
4. Ask: *What creates expansion in my chest? What creates contraction?*
5. Trust the wisdom of the integration point

**Expansion signals:** _______________________
**Contraction signals:** _______________________

### Evening Practice (10 minutes)

**Review:**
- When did you feel most integrated today?
- When did you catch inversion?

**Prayer:**
> "Orient me correctly. Onyx facing heaven, sard providing foundation."

---

## Day 6: Counsel & Confirmation

### Morning Practice (20 minutes)

**Review your clarity from Days 1-5.**

Summarize where you are:
> _______________________________________________
> _______________________________________________

**Identify 2-3 mature believers** who can speak into this:
1. _______________________
2. _______________________
3. _______________________

Criteria: Not yes-men. People with walking-with-God track records who will tell you truth.

**Prepare what you'll share and ask:**
> _______________________________________________

### During the Day

Have the conversations. Key principles:
- Don't ask for permission—you're seeking confirmation
- Share your direction, not your confusion
- Listen for their peace or unease
- Watch body language as much as words

### Evening Practice (15 minutes)

**Journal what you heard:**
> _______________________________________________
> _______________________________________________

**Apply the Three Confirmation Tests:**

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Fruit: Does this direction produce Spirit's fruit? | |
| Peace: Do I have shalom in my spirit? | |
| Counsel: Did mature believers confirm? | |

**If confirmation:** Move toward action.
**If caution:** Return to Day 2 and reassess.

**Prayer:**
> "Give me ears to hear truth, not just what I want to hear."

## Day 7: Holy of Holies Execution

### Morning Practice (30 minutes)

**Enter your Holy of Holies.** Whatever private space is sacred to you.

**Step 1: Offering**
Bring the decision before God as an offering. Not perfection—willingness.

**Step 2: Confession**
Say aloud: *"I release my .007. I choose alignment."*

Name your specific .007:
> "I release my grip on ______________________."

**Step 3: Waiting**
Don't rush. Let covering come. Let peace settle. Stay until you sense release.

**Step 4: Receiving**
> What clarity or peace did you receive?
> _______________________________________________

**Step 5: Execution**
Take the first concrete step. **TODAY. Not tomorrow. Today.**

What specific action will you take right now?
> _______________________________________________

- [ ] Send the email
- [ ] Make the call
- [ ] Sign the thing
- [ ] Set the boundary
- [ ] Begin the conversation
- [ ] Other: _______________________

**Remember:** Aligned action executed imperfectly is infinitely better than perfect vision never embodied.

### Evening Practice (10 minutes)

**Review the seven days:**
- What shifted from Day 1 to Day 7?
- How do you feel after executing?

**Celebrate:** You made an aligned decision. That's rare. That's beautiful.

**Prayer:**
> "Thank You for the guidance. I trust You with the outcome."

## Living in the Rhythm

This 7-day audit isn't a one-time event. It's a rhythm you return to.

**Monthly:** Review your decisions. Did I use the framework? Was I aligned or reactive?

**Quarterly:** Do a full 7-day audit on your biggest pending decision.

**Yearly:** Look back. Where was I oriented correctly? Where did I invert?

---

## Signs You're Living Aligned

- [ ] Decreasing regret over decisions
- [ ] Increasing peace during the decision process
- [ ] Faster discernment (the framework becomes intuitive)
- [ ] Fruit following your choices
- [ ] Less need to justify or explain to others

---

## The Tetrahedron Quick Reference

When you need faster discernment, use this abbreviated version:

1. **BODY:** What does my animal soul want here? (Honor but don't obey cravings)

2. **SPIRIT:** What does my divine soul require? (Love/Faith/Kingdom test)

3. **GAP:** What .007 must I release? (Control, timeline, recognition, etc.)

4. **ACTION:** Execute at .625 with .618 alignment. (Move from union)

---

## Benediction

*God of heaven and earth,*
*You who dwell in the Holy of Holies,*
*You who meet us in the gap between ideal and real,*

*Teach me to make decisions from union, not division.*

*Let my divine soul lead.*
*Let my animal soul serve.*
*Let me release the .007 I'm clinging to.*
*Let me act from aligned wholeness.*

*Make me a leader whose decisions produce fruit.*
*Make me whole—.618 + .382 = 1.000.*
*Make my choices aligned with Your Spirit.*

*In Jesus' name,*
*Amen.*
