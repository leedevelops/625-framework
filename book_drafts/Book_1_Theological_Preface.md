# Theological Clarification for Book 1: Becoming Rooted

Identity, Calling, and the Formation of Glory

# **A Word to the Reader**

Becoming Rooted begins where all leadership must begin: in the soil of identity.   
It explores how God's covenant Name (YHWH) forms the inner architecture of who we are—spirit, soul, and body. It follows the fractal structure of God’s own pattern for calling, formation, and transformation.

This work is deeply theological, emotionally honest, and symbolically rich. As such, it may occasionally use terms such as sacred geometry, pattern, or fractal—words that have been co-opted by other traditions. This is not that.

# **What This Book Is Not**

This is not:  
\- New Age mysticism or universalist theology    
\- Gnostic teaching that hides knowledge behind inner circles    
\- Energy or manifestation doctrine centered on self-divinization    
\- A syncretic blend of world religions or metaphysics

# **What This Book Is**

This book is:  
\- A Christ-centered model of leadership rooted in biblical identity    
\- A deep dive into how God's Name (יהוה) reveals His character—and ours    
\- A covenantal, Spirit-led framework for discipleship, emotional growth, and glory formation    
\- A restoration of the priestly and prophetic pattern of leadership through Jesus the Messiah (Yeshua)

# **Why Use Symbols, Shapes, and Fractals?**

\- The tabernacle was built according to divine pattern (Exodus 25:9)    
\- The Name of God is constructed in sequence (Yod–Heh–Vav–Heh), mirroring identity formation    
\- Creation itself is patterned (Genesis 1), layered with symbolic language and structure    
\- Jesus is the full embodiment of divine order—“the radiance of God’s glory and the exact imprint of His nature” (Hebrews 1:3)

This book reclaims symbolic language as a discipleship tool, not a mystical system.   
You will encounter squares, spirals, and story patterns—not for esoteric power, but to mirror the divine intentionality embedded in the soul.

# **Final Clarification**

This is not about becoming divine.    
It is about becoming rooted in the One who is.

It is not about unlocking hidden knowledge.    
It is about responding to the revealed Name.

It is not about ascending into power.    
It is about descending into glory—formed through fire, struggle, and surrender.

“That Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith… that you may be rooted and grounded in love.” – Ephesians 3:17
