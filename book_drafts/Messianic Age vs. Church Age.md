**Jewish mystical thought about the Messiah (as found in Kabbalistic writings)** and the  **Christian understanding of Jesus as the Messiah**, particularly in how both traditions view **the  present age** and the **future Kingdom age**. 

We’re going to thread together: 

1\. What Kabbalistic Judaism says about the Messiah (Messianic Age vs. Church Age), 2\. How the New Covenant reframes and fulfills those expectations, 

3\. What this means for believers now (who live in the Church Age with the Spirit), 4\. And how the Kingdom Age (Messiah's return) ties it all together. 

**1\. What Kabbalistic Judaism Says About the Messiah** 

In Jewish mystical writings, particularly those influenced by the Zohar and later Kabbalists like  the Ramchal and Chabad Hasidism (e.g., Tanya), the **Messiah** is not merely a political figure— He is a *cosmic restorer*, a **channel through which divine light (God’s infinite presence)** will  fully penetrate the physical world. The Messiah’s coming brings: 

• The **final unification** between the spiritual and physical realms,   
• The **revelation of God’s glory on Earth**,   
• The **correction of creation** (what they call *Tikkun Olam*, the repair of the world), • The **eradication of evil and death**, 

• And the **complete indwelling** of God’s presence within the soul and the cosmos. 

But here’s the key:   
In Kabbalah, **this age of full divine indwelling has not yet come**.   
The Messiah has not come, and until He does, God's presence remains **hidden** and **veiled**, only  accessible through **Torah, commandments, and purification of the soul**. 

They do, however, expect: 

• A **Messianic Age** of global peace, enlightenment, and divine awareness, • The **resurrection of the dead**, 

• The **third Temple**,   
• And the **direct revelation of the Divine Presence** in all things. 

**2\. What They Don’t See: The Church Age (the Mystery  Hidden from the Beginning)** 

From a Christian perspective—especially Paul’s teachings—we see that **Jewish expectation** missed a key mystery:  
**There would be two comings of the Messiah**—first as the **suffering servant**, then as the  **reigning King**. 

Paul calls this a **“mystery hidden from ages past”** (Ephesians 3:5–6): 

• That **Gentiles** would be included in the covenant.   
• That **God's Spirit would be poured out** on *all flesh*, not just prophets and kings. • That the **Church would be the body of Messiah**, a spiritual Temple where God's  presence dwells. 

**The Church Age** (the age we’re in now) is the **first stage of the Messianic mission**: 

• Jesus came and inaugurated the Kingdom **spiritually** (Luke 17:21).   
• He **poured out the Holy Spirit** at Pentecost (Acts 2), allowing God's presence to **dwell  within believers**. 

• But the **full physical and cosmic redemption**—what Kabbalists are still waiting for— has not yet happened. 

So both traditions agree: 

• **We’re not in the fullness yet**.   
• We live in a **time of preparation**.   
• The **Messiah will return to complete what was begun**. 

**3\. The Overlap: What Christians Have Now (and What  We’re Still Waiting For)** 

Let’s bring this back to our earlier discussion on the commandments and the Holy Spirit: 

**What Jews Seek Through Commandments What Christians Receive Through the  Spirit** 

Gradual refinement to become vessels for God’s    
light Inner transformation by the Holy Spirit Elevation of the soul through obedience Sanctification through abiding in Christ Awaiting the Messiah to bring final Tikkun    
(repair) Already in Messiah, waiting for His return Expectation of indwelling glory in the future age Firstfruits of glory now; fullness later Longing for full divine union (D’vekut) Already becoming one with God through the  Spirit 

So Christians already have:  
• **Access to the indwelling Spirit**,   
• **The Word written on our hearts**,   
• The ability to **bring God’s presence through obedience**, 

• But we still await:    
o The **redemption of our bodies** (Romans 8:23),   
o The **full restoration of creation** (Isaiah 11, Revelation 21),   
o And the **return of Christ**, when the **Kingdom will be fully visible**. 

In short: 

**We have the down payment (Holy Spirit), but not the deed (full inheritance).** The Jews are still waiting for the keys. 

We’ve been given them early—but not the whole estate. 

**4\. The Kingdom Age: When Jewish and Christian  Eschatology Converge** 

When Jesus returns, what Kabbalistic Judaism longs for will come to pass: 

• **God’s glory will fill the earth as the waters cover the sea** (Habakkuk 2:14), • **All nations will worship the true God** (Isaiah 2:2–4), 

• **The dead will rise**, and death will be swallowed in victory (Isaiah 25:8, 1 Corinthians  15), 

• **The New Jerusalem** will come down, and **God will dwell with mankind** (Revelation  21:3), 

• The **Kingdom of Heaven will be both visible and physical**. 

The **Church**, having carried the presence of God through the wilderness of the Church Age— just like the Tabernacle in the wilderness—will finally see the **glory cloud settle permanently**. 

This is when: 

• Obedience to the Word will no longer be partial or conflicted—it will be **fully natural**, as  Jeremiah 31:33 foretells. 

• The Holy Spirit’s work will be **complete**—we will be **fully conformed to Christ**. • The unity between **heaven and earth**, long taught in Jewish texts, will be fully revealed  in **Emmanuel—God with us** forever. 

**5\. So What Does This Mean Now?** 

We’re living in **a sacred in-between**:  
• The Jews carry **the memory of the Temple** and **the hope for the Messiah**. • The Church carries **the presence of the Spirit** and **the hope for His return**. 

We have: 

• The **Word**,   
• The **Spirit**,   
• The **calling to live as His body**,   
• But we still suffer, wait, long, and groan (Romans 8:22–25). 

We are in a **“pregnancy” stage**: the life of the Kingdom is growing in us, but the world has not  yet seen its birth. Our job is to **carry the presence**, walk in the Word, and become one with God  so we can **reveal His glory when the fullness comes**. 

**In Summary** 

• **Jewish Kabbalistic thought** sees the Messiah as the one who will bring full union  between God and creation—but doesn't yet see the Church Age or the Holy Spirit’s  indwelling. 

• **Christians live in the revealed mystery**—we already receive God’s presence through  the Spirit, and through the Word, we are being transformed from within. 

• **We are becoming what they are still waiting for**, but both await **the Kingdom Age**,  when **all will be made one**. 

• When Jesus returns, the **Church’s transformation** and **Israel’s expectation** will  converge in **the restoration of all things**. 

*“And the glory of the Lord will be revealed, and all people will see it together.”* —Isaiah 40:5 

Until then: we **obey the Word**, we **walk in the Spirit**, and we **become living Temples**,  preparing the world for **the return of the King**.
