**Why do Jews seem to follow the commandments more faithfully than Christians, even  though Christians have the Holy Spirit?** If we have the Spirit of God dwelling in us, shouldn’t  we naturally be better at obeying the Word? 

**1\. The Jewish Approach: Commandments as the Primary Focus** 

In Jewish thought, **the commandments (mitzvot) are the foundation of one’s relationship  with God**. From birth, Jews are immersed in the **rhythm of obedience**—the Torah, prayer, and  daily discipline shape their **entire way of life**. 

• The Torah is seen as **the direct will of God**, so **obedience is not optional**. • Even if one doesn’t feel spiritual, **action comes first**—spiritual experience follows. • Judaism teaches that **obedience transforms the soul**—through action, **divine presence  is drawn down** into daily life. 

• **Messiah has not yet come**, so Jewish thought places even more weight on **following the  commandments to bring about redemption**. 

This produces a **culture of discipline** where commandments are **not about personal experience  but about responsibility**. Jews **train themselves to obey first, regardless of feelings**, because  **God’s Word is supreme**. 

This is why **Jews tend to "get the commandments right"**—it is engrained into their identity.  **They don’t question whether obedience is necessary—it’s a given**. 

**2\. The Christian Approach: Relationship First, Obedience Second** 

Christianity, especially in the West, has a **different emphasis**—**relationship with God through  faith** takes priority over strict external obedience. 

• **The Holy Spirit transforms us internally**, and obedience is expected to flow **naturally  from that transformation**. 

• Christians emphasize **grace over works** (Ephesians 2:8-9), believing salvation is **not  earned by obedience** but received as a gift. 

• Many Christians **focus on faith and experience**, believing that if they are close to God,  obedience will follow. 

• Because Jesus already fulfilled the Law, many Christians feel **less pressure** to follow  external commandments precisely. 

The result? 

• While Christians experience deep **spiritual intimacy**, they often lack the **structured  discipline** of Torah obedience. 

• Many rely on **feelings of connection to God**, assuming obedience will follow, instead of  **daily structured discipline** like Jews.  
• **Some commandments are seen as “Old Covenant” laws**, leading to confusion about  which ones to follow. 

This **relationship-first approach is good**, but it **can lead to neglecting the discipline of  obedience** when it is not reinforced with action. 

**3\. The Holy Spirit and Obedience: Why Christians Struggle** 

One might ask: **If Christians have the Holy Spirit, why don’t they automatically obey God  perfectly?** 

The answer lies in **how the Spirit transforms us** versus **how Jewish law shapes behavior**: 

| Jewish Approach (Commandments First)  | Christian Approach (Spirit First) Understanding before obedience  Relationship shapes actions  Transformation leads to discipline  The Spirit works internally, so it’s subjective Personal conviction leads obedience |
| ----- | :---- |
| **Obedience before understanding**  |  |
| Actions shape beliefs  |  |
| Discipline trains the soul  |  |
| The Torah is external, so it’s clear  |  |
| The community enforces obedience  |  |

**The Challenge:** 

1\. **Jews follow clear, external laws**—even when they don’t feel spiritual, **they obey out of  discipline**. 

2\. **Christians rely on an internal guide (the Spirit)**—but this requires **maturity and self discipline**, which many don’t develop fully. 

3\. **The Spirit doesn’t force obedience**—it **prompts, convicts, and teaches**, but it’s still up  to the believer to **train themselves in righteousness**. 

This is why **many Christians struggle**—they expect obedience to happen **automatically** rather  than realizing **they must train themselves through daily discipline**. 

**4\. The Jewish-Christian Divide: What Each Group Needs to Learn** Each tradition **excels in one area but lacks in another**. 

 **Jews excel in obedience** but lack the Spirit’s **internal transformation**.  **Christians excel in spiritual intimacy** but struggle with **consistent obedience**. 

**Jews need the Spirit; Christians need the structure of discipline.**  
**What Christians Can Learn from Jews** 

• **Obedience is not based on feelings**—train yourself to follow God's Word even when  you don’t feel inspired. 

• **Action comes before full understanding**—don’t wait until you "feel led"; just obey. • **Daily structure matters**—set rhythms of obedience (prayer, fasting, charity, etc.). • **Holiness is a lifelong discipline**—don’t assume being "saved" means you’ll obey  effortlessly. 

**What Jews Can Learn from Christians** 

• **The Holy Spirit brings inner transformation**—it’s not just about external  commandments. 

• **Salvation is by grace, not by earning righteousness through works** (Romans 3:28). • **God desires intimacy, not just obedience**—obedience should flow from love, not just  duty. 

• **The Messiah has already come and will return**—understanding Jesus helps fulfill their  longing for the Kingdom. 

**5\. The Future Kingdom: When Both Paths Merge** 

In the **Kingdom Age**, these two paths **will merge into one**: 

• **Obedience and relationship will no longer be separate**—the Law will be fully written  on our hearts (Jeremiah 31:33). 

• **Christians will no longer struggle with discipline**—we will have fully **resurrected  bodies that naturally follow God’s will**. 

• **Jews will no longer struggle with a veiled presence of God**—the Messiah will be  revealed in **full glory**. 

The **Church Age is a preparation period**: 

• We are training **to obey God’s Word** while **learning to walk in the Spirit**. • **Jews are still waiting for the full Kingdom**, but **we are being prepared for it now**. • The future will **combine the strengths of both traditions**, bringing **obedience and  divine presence into perfect unity**. 

**Conclusion: Christians Must Train Themselves in Obedience** 

The reason Christians don’t follow **the commandments as well as Jews** isn’t because we lack  truth—it’s because we lack **the discipline of structured obedience**.  
• The **Holy Spirit gives us the ability** to obey, but we must **train ourselves to be  consistent**. 

• Obedience isn’t just about "feeling led"—it’s about **choosing discipline daily**, just as  Jews do. 

• **We are in training for the Kingdom Age**, where we will **walk in full obedience and  full unity with God**. 

**The Spirit is our power; the Word is our foundation.**   
To truly live as God’s people, **we must unite both**—walking in **spiritual intimacy** while  committing to **daily obedience**.
